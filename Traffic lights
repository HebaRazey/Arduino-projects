$$COMPONENTS:
220 Resistorsx3
ledx3(red, orange and green)
connecting wriresx4
Arduino UNO

$$VIDEOS USED AS REFRENCE:
Diyar Hussein- Arduino traffic light
Prakar Gupta- Making Traffic light with arduino basic level

$$CONNECTIONS:
1) connect all led cathodes to the ground of arduino
2) connect green leds anode to pin 4 through 220 ohm resistor
3) connect orange leds anode to pin 3 through 220 ohm resistor
4) connect red leds anode to pin 2 through 220 ohm resistor

$$CODE:
#code by Diyar Hussein- Arduino traffic light
#modified by me

void setup()
{
  pinMode(4, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(3, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(4, HIGH); // For green LED
  delay(3000); // Wait for 3 second
  digitalWrite(4, LOW);

  
  digitalWrite(3, HIGH); // For orange LED
  delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second
  digitalWrite(3, LOW);
  
  
  digitalWrite(2, HIGH);  // For the red LED
  delay(3000); // Wait for 3 second
  digitalWrite(2, LOW); 
}
