$$COMPONENTS;
LEDs x6
220 ohm resistors x6
4 leg pushbutton
1k resistor x1
connecting wires 
breadboard and arduino uno

$$CONNECTIONS (overview);
1) Connect anode of all leds to digital pins of arduino(2,3,4,5,6,7)
2) Connect cathode of leds to common ground through 220 ohm resistors
3) connect one side of pushbutton to 5v of arduino at the other side connect right leg to common ground through 1k resistor
   and left leg to pin 12
4) Watch ref videos to understand connections
