This project involves the design and testing of a DC motor control system that regulates both speed and direction using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) controlled by an Arduino UNO. The L293D motor driver IC, which integrates an H-bridge configuration, is employed to simplify the direction control and transistor switching process.
By varying the PWM duty cycle, the Arduino adjusts the motor’s effective voltage, enabling smooth speed control, while the L293D allows bidirectional current flow for forward and reverse motion. The study investigates the motor’s performance under different duty cycles to analyze its speed response and efficiency. This setup demonstrates the practical application of PWM and transistor-based switching in achieving precise and energy-efficient motor control.
